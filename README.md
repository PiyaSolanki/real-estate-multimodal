# Real Estate Multimodal Price Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using tabular real estate data.
A Random Forest baseline model is implemented before extending the approach to include satellite imagery.

## Model Details
- Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor
- Target: Log-transformed house price
- Metrics: RMSE, R²

## Status
Tabular baseline model completed. Multimodal image-based modeling in progress.
